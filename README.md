Simple working example of [Telegram Web Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps).

## Setup
- Create `.env` file with your bot token.
- Run `npm install`
- Change `APP_BASE_URL` inside `index.js` to your domain.
- Run `npm start`

## Usage
Since it is a basic example, bot will only respond to `/demo` or `/simple` commands every 3 seconds. If you're working on implementing Web Apps to your bot, your library probably already dealing with all the updates and stuff for you.

Tip: Use [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.org/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make local setup available to the Internet.
